# Advent of Code

Participated in years:
- 2023 (code not here)
- 2024
- 2025

This repo contains my daily solutions, possibly notes and optimisations.  

Languages and approaches may vary per day, but mostly I will use C++. In the future I might try Go or Rust.

I will try to keep the code clean but I like writing very concise code in such problems.
